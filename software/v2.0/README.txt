The recommended way to set up software is by downloading one of the following pre-
configured Arduino installation files:

  * Mac: http://rayshobby.net/software/arduino-1.0.5-squarewear-macos.zip
  * Win: http://rayshobby.net/software/arduino-1.0.5-squarewear-windows.zip
  * Linux32: http://rayshobby.net/software/arduino-1.0.5-squarewear-linux32.zip
  * Linux64: http://rayshobby.net/software/arduino-1.0.5-squarewear-linux64.zip
These installation files are based on Arduino 1.0.5 and have pre-installed necessary files to get you started. They also contain drivers for Windows, and SqureWear demos.

After installation, run Arduino 1.0.5 from the installed folder. Then in the menu, select Tools->Boards->SquareWear 2.0

There are many provided example programs, which you can find in File->Examples-
>SquareWear2->...

If you want to install SquareWear 2.0 library into your existing Arduino (1.0 or above). Please follow the instructions below:

  * Copy arduino-1.0.5/hardware/arduino/boards.txt to the corresponding folder in your Arduino installation directory. This will overwirte your existing boards.txt
  * Copy arduino-1.0.5/libraries/SquareWear2 to the corresponding libraries folder in your Arduino installation directory.
